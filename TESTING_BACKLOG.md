## File Sizes Summary
**Code Files (8 files):**
- API Routes: ~26 KB (3 files)
- UI Components: ~54 KB (3 files)
- Documentation: ~14 KB (2 files)
- **Total Code Size: ~94 KB**

**Database Files (6 files):**
- Schema: ~9 KB
- Seed Data: ~22 KB
- Cloud Build Configs: ~3 KB
- **Total Database Setup: ~34 KB**

## Database Size Estimation

### Current Setup
- Schema size: ~9 KB
- Initial seed data: ~22 KB
- Total initial database size: ~31 KB

### Projected Growth (Beach Bar Scenario)
**Assumptions:**
- 200 customers/day (peak season)
- 400 orders/day average
- 100 products in catalog
- 1-3 images per product (50KB each)
- 365 operating days/year
- 5-year projection

**Annual Data Growth:**
- Orders: 400/day × 365 = 146,000 orders/year
- Order items: ~3 items/order = 438,000 items/year
- Customer records: 200/day × 365 = 73,000 new/updated customers/year
- Product images: 100 products × 2 images × 50KB = 10MB (one-time)

**Storage per Record (estimated):**
- Order: ~1KB (header + items)
- Customer: ~0.5KB
- Product: ~2KB
- Images: Stored separately (50MB limit)

**Yearly Database Growth:**
- Orders: 146,000 × 1KB = 146 MB
- Customers: 73,000 × 0.5KB = 36.5 MB
- Products: Minimal growth after initial setup
- **Total Annual: ~182.5 MB**

### Supabase Free Tier Limits
- Database: 500 MB
- File Storage: 50 MB (for images)
- Monthly Active Users: 50,000

### Timeline to Free Tier Exhaustion
- **Database:** 500 MB / 182.5 MB/year ≈ **2.7 years**
- **File Storage:** 50 MB / 10 MB initial ≈ **5 years** (if no additional images)
- **Active Users:** 50,000/month limit (beach bar unlikely to exceed)

### Recommendations
1. **Database:** Monitor growth quarterly, plan migration to paid tier after 2 years
2. **File Storage:** Optimize images (compression, WebP format) to extend limit
3. **Scaling:** Implement data archiving for old orders after 1-2 years
4. **Backup:** Regular backups before hitting limits

## Next Steps
1. Complete unit and integration testing for all features
2. Set up monitoring for database size and performance
3. Plan migration strategy for when limits are approached
4. Consider paid Supabase tier for production scaling</content>
